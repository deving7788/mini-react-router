//Note: 
//Place router.jsx somewhere in your project directory.
//path, component, children, *(error page path), and routes as well as TheNested, Link, and redirectTo are reserved words. 
//Usage for TheNested, Link, and redirectTo is shown as following: 
//In SharedPage.jsx component, import TheNested from router.jsx and use it as <TheNested/>, so as to show all its children. For instance, assuming it has a navbar and a footer, then 
      <Navbar/>
      <TheNested/>
      <Footer/>
//In any components or pages, you can import Link and redirectTo from router.jsx. 
//The former is used like this, <Link to="/about" className="about-link">Go to about page</Link> 
//redirectTo is used to redirect to another page. It must be placed in event handler functions or be put in useEffect, as it triggers component rerendering.
//setBaseURL is used to align browser url. Just feed hostname into it, so that browser url changes correctly.
